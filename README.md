# statisticsGBM
**statisticsGBM** is a *MATLAB*-based *threshold-dynamics* code for simulating the motion of grain boundaries during
grain growth. The original code was first published in [statsticsGBM] (https://github.com/tiagosalvador/statisticsGBM) 
together with [Ref 1] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11574), written by *Tiago Salvador and Selim Esedoglu* in 2019.  This was a modification of threshold-dynamics of [Ref 2] (https://doi.org/10.1002/cpa.21527) that allows anisotropic grain boundary mobilities without significant complications in algorithm.
